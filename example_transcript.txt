Meeting Transcript - Cross-Platform Implementation Project
Date: 2025-08-13
Participants: PM, Tech Lead, Developer

PM: Good morning everyone. We need to discuss porting our Linux stress test utility to Windows. Our enterprise customers are requesting equivalent functionality on Windows systems.

Tech Lead: I've reviewed the existing Linux implementation at https://dsgithub.trendmicro.com/kien-do/ai-hackathon-2025-multiplatform-code. It's a comprehensive stress testing tool that creates users, groups, files with random content, changes ownership, and manages child processes using Linux system calls.

Developer: The current Linux version performs several key operations:
1. Creates and deletes user groups using system() calls to groupadd/groupdel
2. Creates and deletes users using useradd/userdel commands
3. File operations using open(), write(), close(), unlink()
4. Changes file ownership using chown() with getpwnam() and getgrnam()
5. Process management with fork(), pause(), and kill() with SIGKILL
6. Uses POSIX-specific headers and functions throughout

PM: Exactly. We need a Windows equivalent that provides the same stress testing functionality. The key requirements are:
1. Port all Linux system calls to equivalent Windows APIs
2. Maintain the same command-line interface and program flow
3. Replace POSIX user/group management with Windows user/group APIs
4. Convert file operations to Windows file handling
5. Replace fork/kill process management with Windows process creation/termination
6. Ensure the program compiles with MSVC or MinGW on Windows

Tech Lead: The Windows implementation should use:
- Windows API calls instead of Linux system calls
- CreateFile() instead of open()
- Windows user management APIs instead of useradd/groupadd
- CreateProcess() instead of fork()
- TerminateProcess() instead of kill()
- Windows-specific headers like windows.h, userenv.h, etc.

Developer: I'll need to research the equivalent Windows APIs for user/group management. The file operations should map fairly directly, but process management will require a different approach since Windows doesn't have fork().

PM: Perfect. The target repository is https://dsgithub.trendmicro.com/kien-do/ai-hackathon-2025-multiplatform-code. Create a new branch called "windows-port-implementation" and implement stress_test_windows.c alongside the existing Linux version. Also update the Makefile to support both platforms.

Tech Lead: Make sure to maintain the same error handling patterns and return codes. The Windows version should have the same command-line arguments: L (number of files), M (additional content bytes), N (initial file content length), and num_processes (child processes to create).

Developer: I'll implement comprehensive unit tests to ensure the Windows version works correctly. The tests should verify file creation, user management, and process handling on Windows.

PM: Excellent. This cross-platform support will significantly expand our market reach. Let's target completion by end of sprint.

Tech Lead: I'll create the technical design document outlining the Windows API mappings and implementation approach.

PM: Great. Also ensure we have proper documentation for building and running on Windows, similar to our Linux instructions.

Meeting adjourned.
